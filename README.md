### --from-year (-fy), --to-year (-ty):

Here we set where we want our script to **start** and **end** iterating over
years. Many times people include the **current year** in an
effort to add some entropy. Because passwords could be **outdated**, or the
years included could be in the (near) **future**, we are going to add them as a
range. For **online** environments, we would be looking at a conservative
approach and only include ranges in the order of **(-1, +1)** or **(-2, +2)**.
For **offline** environments, the range could be wider to **(-20, +5)** or even
**(-50, +10)**. Output example:

    password2017
    [...]
    password2018
    [...]
    password2019

### --short-year (-sy):

When iterating years, also add its shorter **double digit form**. Output
example:

    password17
    [...]
    password18
    [...]
    password19

### --numbers-file (-nf):

In this argument we are going to select a file containing **numbers** that
people frequently add to their passwords. By default I included **6** sets, the
largest being the **6**, and the rest being **subsets** of the previous one. The
numbers included in the first sets **(1,2…)** are more likely to be present that
the ones **only** included in latest sets **(…5,6)**. Again, for **online**
environments, we would be looking at using the first three sets, where in
**offline** environments, we could use the last ones. By default, the script
uses the set number **2**. Output example:

    password1
    [...]
    password123
    [...]
    password1234

### --symbols-file (-sf):

In this argument we are going to select a file  containing **symbols** that
people frequently add to their passwords. Again, set number **1** is the
shortest, set number **6** is the largest. The symbols included in the first
sets **(1,2…)** are more likely to be present that the ones **only** included in
latest sets **(…5,6)**. By default, the script uses the set number **2**. Output
example:

    password123!
    [...]
    password2018?
    [...]
    password1234.

### --custom-file (-cf):

Here we add anything else we **know** about our targets (and it’s not considered
as the “**base**” of the password itself). Let the creativity roll in! It could
be from **company initials**, **birth dates**, **special dates**… to **specific
years**, **short** **keywords**, etc. This custom strings will be treated in the
same way that the years/numbers. Output example:

    passwordABC
    [...]
    password01011980!
    [...]
    password.admin

### MUTATION_MODE (positional argument):

In this parameter we are going to select how the tool will work when shifting
strings. You can choose one of three:

* **suffix-mode:** It will add years, numbers, symbols and custom **after** the
main string. Example: *password***2018!**
* **prefix-mode:** It will add years, numbers, symbols and custom **before** the
main string. Example: **!2018***password*
* **dual-mode:** As the name suggests, it uses both modes (generates both
outputs).

### STRINGS_FILE (positional argument):

File containing **strings to mutate**. If you’re for example, doing a pentest
and don’t know where to start, I would suggest you using a tool like
[CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) to spider the company website, and
keep the **most recurring words** (including the company name of course).

### OUTPUT_FILE (positional argument):

Simply, file where we want to write the **mutated strings**.

### --symbols-before-suffix (-sbs):

When this flag is enabled, and we are running the tool either  in **suffix-mode** 
or **dual-mode**, the script will also add the symbols **before**
years/numbers/custom. Output example:

    password2018!
    [...]
    password!2018
    [...]

### --symbols-after-prefix (-sap):

When this flag is enabled, and we are running the tool either in **prefix-mode** 
or **dual-mode**, the script will also add the symbols **after**
years/numbers/custom. Output example:

    !2018password
    [...]
    2018!password
    [...]

### --mutation-methods (-mm):

In this parameter we define which mutation methods are going to be performed.
Mutation methods are **base transformations** made **before** starting iterating
over years/numbers/symbols/custom. You can select as many mutation methods as
you want. For a list of all valid mutation methods, check: [MUTATION_METHODS.md](MUTATION_METHODS.md).
By default, **m4ngl3m3!** runs with the following: *Normal, UpperCase, FirstUp and
ReplaceVowels.*
